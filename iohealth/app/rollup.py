"""sample_hourly holds every account's samples summed per type, UTC hour and source, so charts and records over
months or years read a few thousand rows instead of millions. Each upload batch keeps its own account's hours up to

type and one month at a time, for every account at once (small transactions, which a Galera cluster replicates
without trouble). Until a type is filled, its charts read samples."""
