"""ioHealth: the iPhone app's upload API and the fitness web app, on one port (8650), over the ioThing suite's
shared accounts (iosuite-shared, as in every app of the suite).

(the shared session cookie, the identity a reverse proxy such as Cloudflare Access vouches for, or a bearer app
password), whether sign-in is required at all (it always is here: health data is private), and refuses cross-site
