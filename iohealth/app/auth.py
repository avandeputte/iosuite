"""The shared ioThing accounts (iosuite-shared), as ioHealth uses them.

Accounts, passwords, sessions and roles live in the Shared ioSuite database (IOSUITE_DB_*), shared with ioPix,
ioNotes and ioContacts: one sign-in serves every app on the domain (COOKIE_DOMAIN). What is ioHealth's own
stays here: the role an account holds in ioHealth, and its health data, which nobody else sees.

Roles: a viewer sees their own data; a member (the default) can also upload it (the iPhone app signs in as a member or more, with an
app password); an admin can also see Server; accounts, roles and the sign-in
settings are for suite admins (Settings › Security, the Shared ioSuite database).
