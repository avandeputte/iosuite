"""The shared ioThing accounts (iothing-auth), as ioHealth uses them.

Accounts, passwords, sessions and roles live in the suite's auth database (IOTHING_AUTH_DB_*), shared with ioPix,
ioNotes and ioContacts: one sign-in serves every app on the domain (IOTHING_COOKIE_DOMAIN). What is ioHealth's own
stays here: the role an account holds in ioHealth, and its health data, which nobody else sees.

Roles: a viewer sees their own data; an editor can also upload it (the iPhone app signs in as an editor, with an
app password); an admin can also manage the accounts and the sign-in settings.
