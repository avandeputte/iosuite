# ioHealth

Copies your Apple Health data, all of it or just the types you pick, into your own MariaDB database, and gives you a
fitness web app on top of it: dashboards, charts of any metric (stacked or overlaid), workouts with their GPS routes on
a map, sleep, training load and personal records. Nothing goes through a cloud service: an iPhone app uploads straight
to a small server that you run in Docker, over HTTPS behind your reverse proxy (or plain HTTP on your own network).
The same container serves the web app. Accounts are the ioThing suite's shared ones (the same as
[ioPix](https://github.com/avandeputte/iopix), [ioNotes](https://github.com/avandeputte/ionotes) and
[ioContacts](https://github.com/avandeputte/iocontacts)): every person in the household signs in with their own name
and sees only their own health data.

The iPhone app that uploads the data is in its own repository,
[iohealth-apps](https://github.com/avandeputte/iohealth-apps) (Health data only exists on the iPhone), as ioNotes and
ioPix keep theirs in [ionotes-apps](https://github.com/avandeputte/ionotes-apps) and iopix-apps.

## What it does
The fitness web app is built into the server. Open the server's address in a browser (`https://health.example.com`
or `http://192.168.1.10:8650`) and sign in: the sign-in screen is the suite's, with a tile per account (an account
without a password signs in with one click, on the home network only). It shows only the signed-in person's data, and
shows new data as soon as a sync finishes.

The menu is laid out as in ioPix: a sidebar with the pages in groups (Dashboard, Day, Metrics, Workouts; Analysis:
Correlations, Map, Records; Health: Sleep, Glucose), Settings at its foot. On a wide
screen it stays docked beside the page, or its button puts it away (remembered) and the menu button slides it over
the page when needed. On phones the same pages are a bottom bar (Dashboard, Day, Metrics, Workouts) with the rest
under More.

| page | what's on it |
|---|---|
| **Dashboard** | today's Move/Exercise/Stand rings and the last week's, last night's sleep, 14-day blood glucose summary (when there is glucose data), cards for steps, energy, distance, resting heart rate, HRV, VO₂ max, weight, respiratory rate, blood oxygen… (today, 7-day average against the 4 weeks before, 60-day sparkline), recent workouts and weekly training time by activity; a **Heads-up** list (glucose time in range and lows over the last week, resting heart rate up or HRV down against your usual, no sync for a day, goal streaks, misses and trends) |
| **Day** | one day on one page: totals, rings, last night's sleep, workouts, and a timeline of glucose (with carbs), heart rate, steps and energy with sleep and workouts shaded. Previous/next and a date picker; days link here from the workout calendar, the sleep page and correlations |
| **Metrics** | chart any synced type over any range (today, yesterday, 7 days to all time, or custom dates), **zoom and pan** (on every chart: click and drag to move along the timeline, Shift-drag across the chart to zoom in, the mouse wheel, Ctrl/⌘ + scroll or a pinch to zoom, double-click to reset; the detail reloads to fit the view), grouped per sample, hour, day, week, month or year; activity rings too (Move, Exercise and Stand per day, their goals and % of goal); several metrics at once, either **stacked** (one chart each, cursors linked) or **overlaid** (one chart, an axis per unit); min/max bands; **compare** with the previous period or a year earlier (a dashed line, and the change in the table); goal lines; average/min/max/total/trend table. The URL keeps the selection, so a view can be bookmarked |
| **Workouts** | filter by activity and period; totals, a year calendar, time per week or month, training load (fitness, fatigue and form from heart-rate TRIMP), and the list |
| **Workout** | the route on a map coloured by pace, heart rate or elevation; heart rate, pace/speed, elevation and power over time (hovering moves a marker along the route); splits per km or mile; heart rate zones; best 400 m … marathon inside the workout; laps, segments and every statistic |
| **Map** | every GPS route of a period on one map, coloured by activity |
| **Sleep** | stages per night (click one for its timeline), averages, bedtime and wake time, consistency |
| **Glucose** | blood glucose from a CGM or meter: average, GMI (estimated A1c), time in/below/above range, variability (CV), low episodes; readings with your target band and optional overlays (heart rate, steps, carbohydrates, insulin, workouts…); the daily pattern (ambulatory glucose profile) and time in range per day; **glucose around workouts and meals**: the average change from an hour before to three hours after, per activity or per meal size (from logged carbohydrates), and each event's numbers. A workout's own page shows its glucose curve too. mg/dL or mmol/L and the target range are set in Settings |
| **Correlations** | pick two metrics and a period: a scatter plot of the days (click a dot for that day), the correlation, how much one explains the other and the best-fit line, same day or "the day before" (sleep, workouts or carbs, then the next day's glucose). Includes glucose time in range and variability per day and workout minutes. A table ranks what else goes with the second metric |
| **Records** | fastest running efforts from the GPS routes, best days, health bests, ring streaks, and bests per activity |
| **Settings** | in tabs, as in ioContacts and ioCalendar (`#/settings/<tab>`; each tab loads only what it shows). *Account*: who you are, password, sign out. *Display*: km or miles, light/dark theme, and which pages and metrics to show (turn off Sleep, Glucose or any metric you don't use and it disappears from the menu, the dashboard, Metrics and Records). *Health*: glucose unit and target range, maximum heart rate (default 220 − age from your date of birth), your profile. *Goals and alerts*: **goals** (any metric, at least or at most: 10,000 steps a day, weight at most 75 kg, 7.5 h of sleep…) and the thresholds for dashboard alerts. For admins: *Server*: iosuite-shared's panel, the same in every io app: the installed version with Check for updates / Update now and the daily check, the database and time zone, the server log, Restart. For suite admins: *Security* (people and their role in every app, app passwords, sign-in at the proxy) and *Global settings* (the apps, keys and tokens), the suite's admin panel, the same as on the start page and in every io app (iosuite-shared's `/api/suite-admin/ui.js`) |

**Export.** The ⤓ CSV buttons download what a chart or table shows (Metrics, Day, glucose readings and responses,
workouts, sleep, correlations). ⤓ PDF in the header saves the current page through the print dialog, in light colours
without the menus.

**On your phone.** In Safari on the iPhone, Share → Add to Home Screen puts ioHealth on the home screen with its own
icon, opening full-screen like an app (Android: Chrome's menu → Install app). Sign in once there.

How the numbers are made: days and weeks (Monday to Sunday) follow the browser's time zone. Totals such as steps come
from the source that counted the most in each period, so an iPhone and a Watch counting the same steps aren't added
together. A night of sleep is everything from 18:00 to 18:00 the next day, taken from the app that recorded the most
sleep that night. Settings are stored in the database (`hlt_user_settings`, per account), so they follow you to every browser.

The web app's data comes from a JSON API under `/api/` (`types`, `series`, `workouts`, `workouts/{uuid}`, `routes`,
`sleep`, `glucose`, `activity`, `profile`, `records`, `records/efforts`, `status`, and `settings`, which also takes `PUT`; for admins
`server`, which also takes `POST` with `{"action": "check"}`, `{"action": "update"}` or `{"autoCheck": false}`), which also accepts an app password as a bearer token, for
scripts (`Authorization: Bearer iohealth-…`); it answers with that account's data. Map tiles load from OpenStreetMap in the browser; everything else (including the chart and map
libraries, [uPlot](https://github.com/leeoniya/uPlot) and [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com)) is served by the
container.

## Run
The server runs in any of three ways, as ioPix, ioNotes and ioContacts do; pick one:

| | how | where the settings live |
|---|---|---|
| [Docker](#docker-with-compose) | the image `ghcr.io/avandeputte/iohealth` with Compose or `docker run` | the compose file or `-e` flags |
| [Proxmox VE (LXC)](#proxmox-ve-lxc) | one command on the Proxmox host creates a container and sets the server up inside it | `/opt/iohealth/app/config.env` in the container |
| [Standalone](#any-linux-or-mac) | `setup.sh` on any Linux box or Mac: a Python virtual environment and a `systemd` service | `config.env` |

Whichever way, it needs an existing MariaDB (or MySQL) server with two databases on it: one for the health data
(created if the user may; tables are created and migrated at every start) and the **Shared ioSuite** database
(`iosuite`), which holds the accounts and the suite-wide settings for every app in the suite (also created at start; if ioPix, ioNotes or ioContacts
already runs, point ioHealth at the same one and the accounts are there already). It listens on port **8650**, for
both the phone's uploads and the web app; put it behind your reverse proxy for [HTTPS](#reverse-proxy-and-https).

### Proxmox VE (LXC)
`proxmox/ct/iohealth.sh` and `proxmox/install/iohealth-install.sh` follow the community-scripts
(ProxmoxVE) framework layout, the same way as the other apps. On the Proxmox host, as root,

```sh
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/avandeputte/iohealth/main/proxmox/ct/iohealth.sh)"
```

creates a small Debian 13 container (2 CPUs, 1 GB, 4 GB disk by default), puts the server in `/opt/iohealth/app` and
runs its `setup.sh` there. It asks, as the other apps' scripts do, for the MariaDB host, port, database, user and
password of the health data, the same for the Shared ioSuite database (`iosuite` by default; the one ioPix, ioNotes
and ioContacts use), the public address, the cookie domain, the first account (only used when that database is still empty), the time zone and the
port (8650), after the framework's own questions (resources, network). The passwords reach `setup.sh` through its environment (a root-only file pushed in and removed again),
never on a command line; the setup's output is kept in `/opt/iohealth/setup.log`. The MariaDB users must be allowed to connect from the container's address. For unattended runs `IOHEALTH_DB` and
`IOHEALTH_SUITE_DB` (`host:port/db:user:password`), `IOHEALTH_TZ`, `IOHEALTH_PORT`, `IOHEALTH_PUBLIC_URL`, `IOHEALTH_COOKIE_DOMAIN` and
`IOHEALTH_ADMIN` (`name:password`) in the environment answer the questions in advance. `update` inside the container (or "Update now" in the web app) runs
`update.sh`.

### Docker: with Compose
The image is `ghcr.io/avandeputte/iohealth` (public, `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`). Versions up to 1.1.1 were
published as `ghcr.io/avandeputte/healthexport-receiver`; to upgrade, change the `image:` line and pull. Tags: `latest`
(current `main`), `2.0.0` and other release versions, and one tag per branch while it's being worked on.

Save [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) (every option the server understands is in it), fill
in the "CHANGE ME" values, and run `docker compose up -d`; it pulls the published image, and `docker compose up -d
--build` in a clone builds it from the checkout instead.

```sh
docker compose up -d
curl http://localhost:8650/v1/health        # {"ok":true,"schemaVersion":10}
```

Then open `http://localhost:8650/` and sign in (or, on an empty account database, create the first admin right
there). Update later with `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`.

### Docker: with plain `docker run`
```sh
docker run -d --name iohealth --restart unless-stopped -p 8650:8650 \
  -e DB_HOST=db.example.lan -e DB_USER=health -e DB_PASSWORD=change-me -e DB_NAME=health \
  -e IOSUITE_DB_NAME=iosuite -e IOSUITE_DB_USER=iosuite -e IOSUITE_DB_PASSWORD=change-me \
  ghcr.io/avandeputte/iohealth:latest
docker logs -f iohealth
```

(or `--env-file config.env` instead of the `-e` flags, with a copy of `config.env.example`.)

### Any Linux or Mac
```sh
git clone https://github.com/avandeputte/iohealth && cd iohealth
./setup.sh          # asks for the databases, the port and the first account; installs a systemd service when run as root
./run.sh            # or start it in the foreground
./update.sh         # later: the latest code, same settings
```

Its last question, "Also install …?" (flag `--also iocalendar,ionotes`, `--also all`; `IOHEALTH_ALSO` in the environment), puts
other apps of the suite in this same machine, beside ioHealth (`/opt/iocalendar/app` next to `/opt/iohealth/app`),
without asking the shared questions again: the same database server (each app gets its own database: `suite`,
`calendar`, `contacts`, `notes`, `health`, `iopix`; the user needs rights on those names too), the same Shared ioSuite
database, sign-in domain and admin (`iosuite-shared install`, from the shared library). Each app keeps its usual port
and updates itself as always. The Proxmox installer offers the same as a checklist, for one container with several apps.

The databases and users need not exist beforehand: give a MariaDB / MySQL administrator (the question after the
databases; flag `--db-admin USER:PASSWORD`, or `IOHEALTH_DB_ADMIN`, also in the Proxmox installer) and `setup.sh` creates
the app's database and user, the Shared ioSuite database and user and, with other apps installed alongside, their
databases too, with the passwords you answered (`iosuite-shared provision`). Nothing is dropped, and the administrator's
password is used once and not written anywhere.

`setup.sh` takes flags instead of questions (`--db`, `--suite-db`, `--admin` or `--no-admin`, `--port`, `--public-url`,
`--cookie-domain`, `--tz`, `--yes`, the same as every app of the suite; the passwords can come from `IOHEALTH_DB`,
`IOHEALTH_SUITE_DB` and `IOHEALTH_ADMIN` in the environment), writes `config.env` (readable by the owner only), makes
`.venv` (Python 3.11 or later), creates the first admin with `iosuite-shared admin`, installs the `iohealth` systemd
service (`python -m app`) and waits until it answers. Without the service, `./run.sh` starts it in the foreground with
the same `config.env`; a launchd job `net.iothing.iohealth.server` on a Mac can run that script, and "Update now" in the web app restarts
either.

## Configuration
The settings are in `config.env` in the app folder ( the LXC and standalone installs write it, `setup.sh` asks
for the important ones, and `config.env.example` lists them all) or in the environment, which wins (the compose file,
`-e` flags). Every app of the suite uses the same file name and the same names; never commit real values.

| variable | required | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `DB_HOST` | yes | MariaDB host name or IP |
| `DB_PORT` | no | default `3306` |
| `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD` | yes | a user that may create tables in `DB_NAME` (and the database itself, ideally) |
| `DB_NAME` | no | default `health` |
| `IOSUITE_DB_HOST`, `IOSUITE_DB_PORT` | no | the server with the Shared ioSuite database; default: the same as `DB_HOST` / `DB_PORT` |
| `IOSUITE_DB_NAME`, `IOSUITE_DB_USER`, `IOSUITE_DB_PASSWORD` | yes | the Shared ioSuite database (accounts and suite-wide settings; name and user `iosuite` by default) and a user that may create tables in it |
| `PUBLIC_URL` | no | the address people and the other apps reach ioHealth at (`https://health.example.com`); empty: the best address it is reached at |
| `COOKIE_DOMAIN` | no | the domain the session cookie is shared on (`example.com`): signed in at `photos.example.com` is signed in at `health.example.com` too; a LAN address gets its own cookie |
| `ADMIN_USER`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | no | the first account, created on a first start with an empty Shared ioSuite database (or create it from the sign-in screen instead) |
| `TLS_CERT_FILE`, `TLS_KEY_FILE` | no | set both (and mount the files) to serve HTTPS directly instead of behind a proxy |
| `TZ` | no | fallback time zone (e.g. `Europe/Brussels`) for days and weeks; the browser sends its own, so this only matters for API calls without `tz` |
| `MAP_TILE_URL`, `MAP_TILE_ATTRIBUTION` | no | map tiles for routes, default OpenStreetMap (`https://tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png`) |
| `HOST`, `PORT` | no | where the server listens, default `0.0.0.0` and `8650` (every app of the suite has its own port) |
| `FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS` | no | the addresses allowed to pass on the visitor's address and scheme (`X-Forwarded-For` / `-Proto`: your reverse proxy's), default `*`; read by the app itself (iosuite-shared), not by uvicorn |
| `AUTH_PROXY`… | no | sign-in at a reverse proxy or Cloudflare Access, see [HTTPS](#reverse-proxy-and-https) below |
| `UPDATE_CHECK` | no | `0`: never ask GitHub whether a newer version exists (the daily check, see [Updates](#updates)) |
| `DATA_DIR` | no | what ioHealth writes on its own (the server log, the outcome of an update); default `data/` in the app folder |
| `LOG_FILE` | no | the server log shown at Settings › Server (`data/iohealth.log`; empty: no file) |

## Updates
- **Docker:** `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`.
- **Proxmox LXC:** `update` inside the container (the community-scripts command), which runs `update.sh` below.
- **Standalone:** `./update.sh` fetches the latest code (git, or the GitHub tarball when
  there is no checkout), installs the packages the new version asks for and only then moves the code in, then
  restarts the service. `--check` only reports; `IOHEALTH_REF=<sha>` installs that commit.
- **From the web app:** Settings › Server (admins), the same page in every ioThing app (it comes from
  `iosuite_shared.updates` in iosuite-shared, at `/api/server` and `/api/log`), shows the installed version and commit,
  "Check for updates" compares it with GitHub's `main`, and "Update now" runs `update.sh` (in Docker it says to pull
  instead); below it the tail of the server log (`data/iohealth.log` in the app folder; `LOG_FILE` moves it, empty switches it
  off) and Restart. A daily check (on by default; `UPDATE_CHECK=0` locks it off, the page switches it off) shows admins
  a card when a newer version exists, with Update now right on it. Only the public commit list is fetched; nothing
  about the install is sent.

## Reverse proxy and HTTPS
The server speaks plain HTTP; put it behind your reverse proxy for HTTPS. With Caddy, which gets a certificate by
itself:

```
health.example.com {
    reverse_proxy 192.168.1.10:8650
}
```

With nginx:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name health.example.com;
    # ssl_certificate / ssl_certificate_key …
    client_max_body_size 100m;     # batches are gzip-compressed and normally well under 1 MB
    proxy_read_timeout 300s;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://192.168.1.10:8650;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;   # marks the session cookie Secure
    }
}
```

Traefik: route the host to port 8650 and raise the body limit if you use the buffering middleware. If the proxy runs
in the same Docker network, use `iohealth:8650` as the upstream. The phone allows plain `http://` only to local
network addresses; anything else must be `https://`.

When the proxy already makes people sign in (Cloudflare Access, Authelia, oauth2-proxy…), ioHealth takes that sign-in,
exactly as the other apps in the suite do: the proxy passes who signed in in a header, and ioHealth treats that person
as signed in when an account exists for them (matched on the account's email address, then its name). Set it up once
for the whole suite in Settings › Security › Sign-in at the proxy (it's kept in the shared account database), or in the
environment, which wins: `AUTH_PROXY` (`cloudflare`, `haproxy`, `nginx`, `caddy`, `traefik` or `header`),
`AUTH_PROXY_HEADER`, `AUTH_PROXY_TRUSTED` (the addresses the proxy connects from), `AUTH_PROXY_CREATE` (`viewer`
or `editor` to create an account for someone new, `deny` for a "No access" page), and for Cloudflare Access
`CF_ACCESS_TEAM` and `CF_ACCESS_AUD` (the signed token Cloudflare adds to every request is checked against your
team's keys). The header is believed only from the proxy's own addresses. The iPhone's uploads carry the account's own
user name and password instead, so for a server behind Cloudflare Access the upload paths (`/v1/`) need a bypass
rule or a Cloudflare service token.

## Users and permissions
**Accounts** are the ioThing suite's shared accounts ([iosuite-shared](https://github.com/avandeputte/iosuite-shared): the
Shared ioSuite database in MariaDB, shared with ioPix, ioNotes and ioContacts), so one name, password and session serve every app, and
someone signed in at `photos.example.com` is signed in at `health.example.com` too when the apps share a domain
(`COOKIE_DOMAIN`). What is ioHealth's own is kept per app: the role an account holds here, its settings and
its health data. A *suite admin* is admin in every app.

| who | can |
|---|---|
| not signed in | nothing but the sign-in screen (there is no shared data to look at) |
| **viewer** | see their own data, and their own settings and goals |
| **editor** | plus upload: the iPhone app signs in as an editor |
| **admin** | plus Server in Settings; accounts, roles and the sign-in settings are for suite admins (Settings › Security) |

Settings › Account is where you change your password. The iPhone app signs in with this server's address, your user
name and your password; a script can use an **app password** instead (made by a suite admin under Settings › Security › App passwords). Sessions are random tokens in an HttpOnly cookie (`iothing_session`, shared
by the apps on the domain) valid for 30 days and renewed while in use; passwords are scrypt-hashed; wrong passwords
cost a growing wait.

## API
Every `/v1` call except `/v1/health` needs the account's `Authorization: Basic <user:password>` (what the iPhone app
sends) or `Bearer <app password>`, of an editor or admin; what is sent becomes that account's. Errors
are JSON `{"error": "…"}` with 400, 401, 403, 404 or 413.

| request | body | reply |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /v1/health` | | `{"ok":true,"schemaVersion":N}` |
| `POST /v1/sessions` | `{"deviceName","systemVersion","fullResync"}` | 201 `{"sessionId":N}` |
| `POST /v1/sessions/{id}/items` | NDJSON lines as in `Shared/SyncProtocol.swift` (in iohealth-apps), optionally `Content-Encoding: gzip`; header `X-Batch-Seq: n` | `{"applied":k}` |
| `POST /v1/sessions/{id}/finish` | `{"totalSent":N}` | `{"received":N}` (items the session applied) |

Each batch is committed in one transaction together with its sequence number, so a batch resent after a lost reply is
acknowledged (`"duplicate":true`) without being applied twice. Every write is an upsert keyed on HealthKit's UUIDs, so
resending anything is safe.

## The iPhone app
Build and install it from [iohealth-apps](https://github.com/avandeputte/iohealth-apps), whose README has the steps.
On the phone, enter this server's URL (`https://health.example.com`, or `http://192.168.1.10:8650` at home) and your
user name and password, then **Sync now**. Later syncs only send what's new or changed; with "Sync automatically" on
the phone also syncs in the background when new Health data arrives. The server has to be reachable at that moment; a
missed or cut-short round costs nothing, because the phone only moves on for batches the server has acknowledged.

The account the phone signs in with must be an **editor** (or admin) in ioHealth; a viewer can look but not upload.
Everyone in the household gets their own account, and the phones upload side by side into the same database, each
row tagged with its owner.

## The database
Every table is `hlt_<name>` (the suite's naming convention, so the apps can share one database), InnoDB/utf8mb4 with timestamps in UTC as `DATETIME(3)`, and every data row has a `user_id`: the
account it belongs to (its id in the shared account database's `ios_users` table). `SELECT … WHERE user_id = 1` is one
person; the examples below are for everyone at once.

| table | contents |
|---|---|
| `hlt_samples` | every quantity and category sample: `type` (a short snake_case name: `heart_rate`, `step_count`, `sleep_analysis`, `vo2_max`…), `kind` (`quantity`/`category`/…), `value`, `unit`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `count` (more than 1 for samples some apps pre-aggregate), `text` (names for category values such as `asleep`, `deep`, `rem`, or audiogram points as JSON), `source_name` (the app or device that recorded it), `metadata_json` |
| `hlt_workouts`, `hlt_workout_statistics`, `hlt_workout_events`, `hlt_workout_activities` | workouts and their per-workout heart rate / distance / energy stats, laps and pauses, and multisport segments |
| `hlt_workout_route_points` | GPS traces (lat, lon, altitude, speed, course, accuracy) |
| `hlt_heartbeats` | beat-to-beat intervals behind HRV readings |
| `hlt_activity_summaries` | daily Move / Exercise / Stand rings and goals |
| `hlt_characteristics` | date of birth, biological sex, blood type, skin type, wheelchair use |
| `hlt_sample_hourly`, `hlt_sample_hourly_ready` | every type summed per UTC hour and source (sum, count, min, max), so charts and records over months or years read thousands of rows instead of millions; kept current by each sync |
| `hlt_user_settings` | ioHealth's settings, per account |
| `hlt_deleted_objects`, `hlt_sync_log`, `hlt_schema_version` | bookkeeping |

Every data table also has `created_at` (when the server first stored the row) and `updated_at` (when its values last
changed; equal to `created_at` until then), both UTC. Resending unchanged data touches neither. The lap, pause and
multisport rows of a workout are rewritten whenever the workout is resent, so theirs restart then. Rows written
before these columns existed (schema versions below 5) have `NULL`.

When the server first starts on schema 8 or later it fills `hlt_sample_hourly` for existing data in the background, one
type and one month per transaction (small enough for a Galera cluster to replicate comfortably); charts read `hlt_samples`
directly until each type is done, and the log says when it has finished. Schema 9 (ioHealth 2.0) adds `user_id`; schema 10 adds it to the views below; schema 11 (ioHealth 2.8) gives every table, view and index the `hlt_` prefix and renames `inserted_at` to `created_at`, in place.

Two views report how long samples take to arrive (`created_at` minus the sample's `end_date`, in minutes, which
includes the Watch-to-iPhone hop): `hlt_sample_delay_by_type` (per account and type: count, min/avg/max delay, latest sample, latest
arrival) and `hlt_sample_delay_by_day` (the same per type and per day of arrival, UTC).

Type names are the HealthKit identifier without its prefix, in snake_case (`HKQuantityTypeIdentifierHeartRateVariabilitySDNN`
→ `heart_rate_variability_sdnn`); the phone and the server share the rule (`HealthTypes.storageName`,
`app/db.py`'s `storage_name`). Units are your Health app's preferred units (kg or lb, km or mi…) where Apple exposes them,
otherwise metric; the `unit` column always says which.

```sql
-- resting heart rate, last 30 days
SELECT DATE(start_date) d, ROUND(AVG(value)) bpm
FROM hlt_samples WHERE type = 'resting_heart_rate'
GROUP BY d ORDER BY d DESC LIMIT 30;

## Not included
- **ECGs**: the iPhone app doesn't request or send them (the voltage traces are most of the data by volume).
- **Vision prescriptions**: HealthKit only allows reading them one prescription at a time, with a separate prompt.
- **Clinical (FHIR) health records** need the separate "Clinical Health Records" entitlement, which Apple grants
  per app.
- Data the Watch has purged (very old raw samples that the phone never received).

## Tests
`python -m pytest tests` (after `pip install -e ".[test]"`) runs the tests against a real MariaDB
(`IOSUITE_TEST_DB=host:port:user:password`, as in every app of the suite; default `127.0.0.1:3306:health:health`; it makes and drops
databases of its own, `health_test`, `iosuite_test_iohealth` and `health_mig_test`, so the user needs `CREATE` and `DROP`). CI runs the same on every pull request (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

## Layout
| path | what |
|---|---|
| `app/` | the FastAPI service: the upload API (`/v1`), the web app's API (`/api`), the database and its migrations; accounts through the suite's [iosuite-shared](https://github.com/avandeputte/iosuite-shared) |
| `static/` | the web app (one page, `app.js`, `app.css`, the chart and map libraries, icons) |
| `tests/` | the tests, on a real MariaDB |
| `proxmox/` | the Proxmox VE LXC scripts (`ct/` on the host, `install/` in the container) |
| `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml` | the image and how to run it |
| `setup.sh`, `run.sh`, `update.sh` | standalone install, start and update |
| `config.env.example` | every setting |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | the tests, then the image |
